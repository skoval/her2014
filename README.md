### Why aren't more women R users? 

The "heR Panel Discussion and Mixer" will be an opportunity for useR!
attendees to discuss the shortage of women in the R development community and whether gender makes a difference for software development. 

The panel will be held from **7 to 7:45 pm on July 1 at the [Venice Meeting Room](http://maps.ucla.edu/campus/) at Carnasale Commons**. The panel will include a distinguished group of women developers and statisticians who will take questions from the
audience on the topic of gender and R development. A social mixer will begin at 6:30 pm, before the panel, and will continue after the panel's conclusion. _All conference attendees are welcome._
